# Transfermarkt Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes data from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), a popular website for football transfer information. In this project, we will perform statistical analyses using data collected from specific seasons of football leagues in various countries and answer some interesting questions using machine learning tools.

The project begins with the data scraping process, where relevant information is extracted from Transfermarkt. To ensure compatibility with the analysis implementations, a well-defined database schema is designed. The scraped data is subsequently stored in the database for further analysis.

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data extraction and collection**: This step involves extracting the necessary data from Transfermarkt using web scraping techniques. Various attributes such as player details and team information are collected.

2. **Database design**: A suitable database schema accommodates the scraped data. This schema is implemented, and the collected data is stored in the database for efficient querying and analysis in subsequent steps.

3. **Statistical analysis**: The collected data is subjected to various statistical analyses to gain insights and uncover patterns. This may include calculating player statistics, team performance metrics, transfer trends, or any other relevant analysis.

4. **Estimation and use of machine learning tools**: Building upon statistical analysis, machine learning models are developed to predict specific outcomes or make informed decisions based on the available data. This step involves feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.
